Based on the following prompt, help me to generate a new markdown file that includes a detailed plan on how to implement the project. Initiate a CLAUDE.md file as the main memory file. The project is to create a AI-driven Quant Trading Bot that can analyze market data, make predictions, and execute trades automatically. The bot should be able to learn from historical data and adapt its strategies over time. The AI would use the Interactive Brockers API for trading and data retrieval. The project will be structured in several phases, including research, development, testing, and deployment.
